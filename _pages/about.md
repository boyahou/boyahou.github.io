I am a final year PhD student in the ECE department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](http://boses.ece.illinois.edu/). I received B.Tech. from Zhejiang University and M.Eng. from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2019.

# Research:
My research centers around compressed learning and decision-making in uncertain environments: I draw on tools from applied mathematics, machine learning, and control theory to develop data-efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees. 

- ## Compressed Learning of Dynamical Systems:

    I am interested in learning compressed representations of dynamical systems from data in single-agent and multi-agent contexts. My research focuses on an operator-theoretic approach to capture the action of the system dynamics on [Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space). I integrated this approach into reinforcement learning, characterization of regions of attraction, uncertainty propagation, and transient stability analysis of power systems.

- ## Preparing Electrified Transportation:
   Electrification can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The transition away from the jet fuel-powered airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In order to handle the impending electrification of commercial aviation, we study the interdependency of transportation (airlines) and the energy infrastructure at airports.

# Teaching
Fall 2021, Teaching Assistant, ECE 365 Data Science and Engineering, UIUC.

# Fun
Outside of mathematics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dancing. I performed contemporary ballet and dance of the Han-Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) with Champaign Park District and Zhejiang Wenqin Art Troupe.
