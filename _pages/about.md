Thanks for visiting! I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the ECE department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](http://boses.ece.illinois.edu/). I received M.Eng. from UIUC and B.S. from Zhejiang University in 2019. I am broadly interested in the area of autonomy. 

My CV can be found here (April 2024) [CV](../assets/BoyaCV.pdf).

# News:
April 2024: I'll be presenting my work at [the 10th Midwest Workshop on Control and Game Theory](https://mwcgt2024.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern, and [the 4th Symposium on Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/boumedienehamzi/home/fourth-symposium-on-machine-learning-and-dynamical-systems) at the Fields Institute.

# Research

- ## Nonparametric Compressed Learning of Dynamical Systems:

   In my research, I aim to reconcile the classical model-based approach with the modern learning-based approach, where the role of a model is to represent an agent's existing knowledge and yet to allow for data-driven tuning to perfect control designs.

  The key threads of my research methodology are (a) an operator-theoretic approach to build an analytically tractable representation of environments; and (b) selective loss of details via compression to control model complexity.

- ## Preparing Electrified Transportation:
   Electrification can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The transition away from the jet fuel-powered airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In order to handle the impending electrification of commercial aviation, I study the interdependency of transportation (airlines) and the energy infrastructure at airports.

# Teaching
Fall 2021, Teaching Assistant, ECE 365 Data Science and Engineering, UIUC.

# Fun
Outside of mathematics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dancing. I performed contemporary ballet and dance of the Han-Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) with Champaign Park District and Zhejiang Wenqin Art Troupe.
