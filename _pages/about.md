I am a final-year PhD student in the ECE department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](http://boses.ece.illinois.edu/). Prior to this, I received B.Tech. from Zhejiang University and M.Eng. from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, both in 2019. 
 

My CV can be found here [cv_Boya](../assets/BoyaCV.pdf).


# Research:
My research interests lie in the area of autonomy. I draw on tools from applied mathematics, machine learning, and control theory to develop efficient data-driven algorithms in uncertain environments with theoretical guarantees, with a focus on applications to electric power grids and electrified transportation.


- ## Compressed Learning of Dynamical Systems:

   In my research, I aim to reconcile the classical model-based approach with the modern learning-based approach, where the role of a model is to represent an agent's existing knowledge and yet to allow for data-driven tuning to perfect control designs. By jointly utilizing models and data, one improves the efficiency of data-driven algorithms since models eliminate the computational burden of learning from scratch. The key threads of my research methodology are:
  
1. Building an analytically tractable representation of an agent's knowledge to facilitate learning and decision-making.
2. Selective loss of details via compression to control model complexity without inducing performance degradation.

    I am interested in learning compressed representations of dynamical systems from data in single-agent and multi-agent contexts. My research focuses on an operator-theoretic approach to capture the action of the system dynamics on [Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space). I integrated this approach into reinforcement learning, characterization of regions of attraction, uncertainty propagation, and transient stability analysis of power systems.

- ## Preparing Electrified Transportation:
   Electrification can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The transition away from the jet fuel-powered airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In order to handle the impending electrification of commercial aviation, we study the interdependency of transportation (airlines) and the energy infrastructure at airports.

# Teaching
Fall 2021, Teaching Assistant, ECE 365 Data Science and Engineering, UIUC.

# Fun
Outside of mathematics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dancing. I performed contemporary ballet and dance of the Han-Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) with Champaign Park District and Zhejiang Wenqin Art Troupe.
