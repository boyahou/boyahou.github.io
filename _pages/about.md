I am a final-year PhD student in the ECE department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](http://boses.ece.illinois.edu/). I received M.Eng. from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and B.Tech. from Zhejiang University in 2019. 
 

My CV can be found here [cv_Boya](../assets/BoyaCV.pdf).



- ## Nonparametric Compressed Learning of Dynamical Systems:

   In my research, I aim to reconcile the classical model-based approach with the modern learning-based approach, where the role of a model is to represent an agent's existing knowledge and yet to allow for data-driven tuning to perfect control designs. The key threads of my research methodology are:
  
  + An operator-theoretic approach to build an analytically tractable representation of environments.
  + Selective loss of details via compression to control model complexity.

- ## Preparing Electrified Transportation:
   Electrification can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The transition away from the jet fuel-powered airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In order to handle the impending electrification of commercial aviation, I study the interdependency of transportation (airlines) and the energy infrastructure at airports.

# Teaching
Fall 2021, Teaching Assistant, ECE 365 Data Science and Engineering, UIUC.

# Fun
Outside of mathematics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dancing. I performed contemporary ballet and dance of the Han-Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) with Champaign Park District and Zhejiang Wenqin Art Troupe.
