I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the ECE department at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](http://boses.ece.illinois.edu/). Prior to this, I received M.Eng. from UIUC and B.S. from Zhejiang University in 2019. 


# News:
April 2024: Invited presentation at [Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems Seminar](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/machine-learning-and-dynamical-systems) at the Alan Turing Institute and [the 4th Symposium on Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/boumedienehamzi/home/fourth-symposium-on-machine-learning-and-dynamical-systems) at the Fields Institute.

April 2024: I'll present at [the 10th Midwest Workshop on Control and Game Theory](https://mwcgt2024.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern.

- ## Preparing Electrified Transportation:
   Electrification can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The transition away from the jet fuel-powered airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In order to handle the impending electrification of commercial aviation, I study the interdependency of transportation (airlines) and the energy infrastructure at airports.

# Teaching
Fall 2021, Teaching Assistant, ECE 365 Data Science and Engineering, UIUC.

# Fun
Outside of mathematics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dancing. I performed contemporary ballet and dance of the Han-Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) with Champaign Park District and Zhejiang Wenqin Art Troupe.
