I am a 4th year PhD student with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](http://boses.ece.illinois.edu/). Prior to this, I received Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in December 2019 and BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Zhejiang University in March 2019. 
My research interests are in the areas of data-driven learning and control, in single/multi-agent setting, with a focus on applications to electric power grid and electrified transportation.

# Research:

- ## Sparse learning of dynamical system:
    I focus on learning non-parametric sparse representations of dynamical system in [Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space) with theoretical guarantees. Its applications include value functions approximation of MDPs, characterization of region of attractions, uncertainty propagation and transient stability analysis of power systems.

- ## Preparing electrified transportation:
   Electrification can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The transition away from the jet fuel-powered airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In order to handle the impending electrification of commercial aviation, we study the interdependency of transportation (airlines) and the energy infrastructure at airports.

# Teaching
Fall 2021, Teaching Assistant, ECE 365 Data Science and Engineering, UIUC.

# Fun
Outside of mathmatics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dancing. I performed contemporary ballet and dance of the Han-Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) with Champaign Park District and Zhejiang University Wenqin Art Troupe.
