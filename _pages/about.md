I am a postdoctoral research associate hosted by Prof. [Maxim Raginsky](https://maxim.ece.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Olgica Milenkovic](https://publish.illinois.edu/milenkovic/) at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I obtained my Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UIUC, advised by Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](http://boses.ece.illinois.edu/). Prior to this, I received B.S. from Zhejiang University and M.Eng. from UIUC in 2019. 


# Research

Autonomous systems are just around the corner. Different from “automated” agents that operate in a fixed world, “autonomous” ones should be able to conceptualize, reason, and act in changing environments without human intervention. How can autonomous agents understand the environment landscape? How to learn a representation of the environment such that knowledge can be transferred to related environments, and extrapolated to unknown environments? How could we control the complexity of such a representation? The goal of my research is to answer these questions.

- ## Preparing Electrified Transportation:
   Electrification can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation. The transition away from the jet fuel-powered airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In order to handle the impending electrification of commercial aviation, I study the interdependency of transportation (airlines) and the energy infrastructure at airports.

# Teaching
Fall 2021, Teaching Assistant, ECE 365 Data Science and Engineering, UIUC.

# Fun
Outside of mathematics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dancing. I performed contemporary ballet and dance of the Han-Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) with Champaign Park District and Zhejiang Wenqin Art Troupe.
