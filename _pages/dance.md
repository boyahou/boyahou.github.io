Outside of mathematics and engineering, I pursue my passion for dance.  
I perform contemporary ballet and Dance of the Han–Tang dynasties (a subcategory of Classical Chinese Dance) and have performed with the Champaign Park District and the Zhejiang Wenqin Art Troupe.

Below are a few photos from rehearsals and performances.
